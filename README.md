# Othello
This game was made in Fall 2016 for COP3330 (Object-oriented Programming). This entire project was written with Java 8 and Swing in the NetBeans IDE.
- All source code can be found under the *src* folder under any of the three *Othello* folders.
- The distributable JAR file can be found under the *dist* folder under any of the three *Othello* folders.

## Othello
This folder contains all class files, source files, and relevant files for the game Othello. This folder contains my original submission to Dr. Whiting.

## Othello_Eli
This folder is nearly identical to the *Othello* folder, but I changed the board background color and game pieces. This *JAR* file was distributed to my friend Eli.

## Othello_Gavin
This folder is nearly identical to the *Othello* folder, but I changed the board background color and game pieces. This *JAR* file was distributed to my friend Gavin for his birthday.
